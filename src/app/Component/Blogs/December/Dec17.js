      <h5 className='fw-bold'>1. The Business Never Sleeps </h5>
      <p className='para-color'>Small businesses aren't fibro enought to have a support centre open 24 hours. Such a poor customer could log onto his or her computer at 10 PM on a Sunday and fire away queries. These will be remedied by WhatsApp chatbots, giving instantaneous automated answers to consumer queries at any hour, day or night. This means your customers never have to face wait to receive assistance. </p>
       <h5 className='fw-bold'>2. Affordable Solution </h5>
       <p className='para-color'>Dedicating the hiring and training of a customer service department could reasonably cost you a good amount. What WhatsApp chatbots actually do help you to handle such a huge number of queries without massively increasing your operational cost. </p>
       <h5 className='fw-bold'>3. Prompt Replies to Customer Queries </h5>
       <p className='para-color'>The Bangalore intimidatingly quick market demands a home for rapid customer service. WhatsApp chatbots promise quick responses to the most common inquiries regarding product availability, pricing, and service details, which keeps the customers busy. </p>
       <h5 className='fw-bold'>4. Streamlined Appointment Booking </h5>
       <p className='para-color'>Having a salon, clinic, or repair shop in the service-based industry, appointment booking is made easy by a WhatsApp chatbot because customers are able to check if slots are available and confirm bookings directly via the chatbot. </p>
       <h5 className='fw-bold'>5. Multilingual Support</h5>
       <p className='para-color'>Indeed, in a permutation-ridden, multi-lingual cosmopolitan city like Bangalore, the most singular feeling is to have a consumer in the their preferred tongues. WhatsApp chatbot would make it possible to converse in many languages instead of a particular language in such a way that language inequalities are obliterated; consumers feel much happier. </p>

      </div>
       <h5 className='fw-bold'>6. Improved Lead Generation </h5>
       <p className='para-color'>The WhatsApp conversation bot would be able to collect names, emails, and, most crucially, preferences as it converses with users. Later these will be leveraged into leads for the petty business which are finally converted to loyal customers. </p>
       <h5 className='fw-bold'>7. Automated Order Tracking </h5>
       <p className='para-color'>In Bangalore's e-commerce system, WhatsApp Chatbot makes order tracking easy for customers, as they would have to send a message to inquire. If they wish to know the status of their order, the estimated time of delivery, or perhaps a shipping update, customers do not have to get in touch with a human. </p>
       <h5 className='fw-bold'>8. Personalized Customer Interactions </h5>
       <p className='para-color'>In these conditions, the customer can get tempted to receive more personalization when the company goes on in detail regarding recommendation, offers, and discounts throughout the interaction due to the analysis of customer behavior and preferences that chatbots have. </p>
       <h5 className='fw-bold'>9. Scalability  </h5>
       <p className='para-color'>Handling increased customer interaction is often a problem as the business grows; WhatsApp chatbots can manage thousands of conversations at a time without any impact on the movement of the business. </p>
       <h5 className='fw-bold'>10. Better Customer Retention  </h5>
       <p className='para-color'>A happy customer tends to return more as compared to a dissatisfied customer. WhatsApp chatbots help a business in retaining its customers and developing a long-standing relationship through quick, accurate, and consistent support. </p>
