      <p>Last Updated: August 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Refund Policy (“Policy”) explains the terms and conditions under
        which refunds may be provided for purchases made on or through{" "}
        <strong>A2ZSMS Services</strong>. By making any payment to A2ZSMS
        Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to
        the terms outlined in this Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Nature of Our Services</h2>
      <p>
        A2ZSMS Services provides bulk messaging, transactional SMS, OTP
        delivery, voice call services, and other communication solutions. All
        purchases are for the acquisition of <strong>prepaid credits</strong>{" "}
        (also referred to as “tokens”) that can be used within our platform to
        send messages or access our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a payment is made, the corresponding credits are automatically and
        instantly added to your account and are available for immediate use.
        Because these credits are digital, consumable, and accessible instantly,
        all sales are considered final.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Demo and Testing Before Purchase</h2>
      <p>
        We understand the importance of evaluating a service before committing
        to payment. For this reason, A2ZSMS Services provides a{" "}
        <strong>free demo account</strong> or test credits to allow you to
        experience our platform’s functionality, delivery rates, and user
        interface before making a purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly encourage all customers to utilize the demo before
        purchasing credits. By proceeding with payment, you confirm that you are
        satisfied with the demo results and the quality of the services offered.
      </p>

      <h2>3. No Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        All payments made to A2ZSMS Services are <strong>non-refundable</strong>{" "}
        except as expressly provided in Section 4 (“Exceptions”). This is
        because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Credits are issued instantly upon payment confirmation.</li>
        <li>Credits can be used anytime during their validity period.</li>
        <li>
          Our system provides the ability to test services before purchase.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A change of mind, dissatisfaction after use, or inability to utilize
        services due to reasons beyond our control (e.g., incorrect mobile
        numbers, poor network conditions, DND restrictions, regulatory blocking)
        do not qualify for a refund.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Exceptions to the No Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        While refunds are generally not provided, exceptions may be considered
        under the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Duplicate Payment:</strong> If you accidentally make the same
          payment more than once for the same order and credits are duplicated
          in error.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment Deducted but Credits Not Received:</strong> If a
          payment is successfully charged to your account but credits are not
          added, and our technical team is unable to resolve it within 7
          business days.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regulatory Restrictions:</strong> If after purchase,
          government regulations restrict the use of the service entirely, and
          credits remain unused.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All such refund requests must be supported by valid proof of payment
        (transaction ID, payment gateway receipt, etc.).
      </p>

      <h2>5. Process for Requesting a Refund</h2>
      <p>To request a refund under the limited exceptions above:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>

          of the issue.

      </ol>
      <p>

        refund through the original payment method within 14 business days after
        approval.
      </p>

      <h2>6. No Refund for Used or Partially Used Credits</h2>
      <p>
        Once credits are used, either fully or partially, no refund will be
        provided for the portion that has been consumed. This applies even if
        the usage results did not meet expectations due to factors outside our
        control (e.g., recipient device issues, incorrect numbers, network
        failures).
      </p>

      <h2>7. Responsibility of the Customer</h2>
      <p>It is the customer’s responsibility to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure the accuracy of the data uploaded for message delivery.</li>
        <li>Test the platform using the free demo before making a purchase.</li>
        <li>
          Understand applicable telecom regulations and restrictions in their
          region.
        </li>
        <li>Maintain sufficient account balance to complete campaigns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        In the event of a payment dispute, customers are encouraged to first
        contact A2ZSMS Services directly to seek a resolution. We will make
        reasonable efforts to resolve issues promptly and fairly. Chargebacks or
        payment disputes raised without following this process may result in
        suspension of your account.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
      <p>
        A2ZSMS Services reserves the right to update or modify this Refund
        Policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be posted on
        our website, and the “Last Updated” date will be revised accordingly.
        Continued use of our services after such changes constitutes acceptance
